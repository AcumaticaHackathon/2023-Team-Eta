### ACU AI

ACU AI is a product developed to integrate ChatGPT into the Cases module to allow Customer Service to leverage AI. Using Business Events and Import Scenarios with this product, we've create a completly automated process of answers end customer inquiries. The question prompted in the case is combined with sales history information to a custom ChatGPT model to allow the AI to generate response to questions like "What is the current status of my order" or "How many legos have been shipped".
